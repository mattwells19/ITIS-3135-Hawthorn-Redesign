# Hawthorn Hall - UNCC FLC Website Redesign

## For ITIS-3135 Web-App Design and Development

This contains the semester project which, for me, was a redesign of the UNCC Freshman Learning Community Hawthorn Hall's website.

This project utilizes the following web technologies:
* HTML
* CSS
* JS
* JQuery
* JQuery UI
* JQuery Plugins
  * [animateScroll](https://plugins.compzets.com/animatescroll/)
  * [calendar](http://kthornbloom.com/monthly/)
* AJAX
