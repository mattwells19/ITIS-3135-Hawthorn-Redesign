## Exercises
This folder contains assignments done for class.

## Project
This contains the semester project which, for me, was a redesign of the UNCC Freshman Learning Community Hawthorn Hall's website. The original site is here: https://osds.uncc.edu/freshman-learning-community/overview

This project utilizes the following web technologies:
* HTML
* CSS
* JS
* JQuery
* JQuery UI
* JQuery Plugins
  * [animateScroll](https://plugins.compzets.com/animatescroll/)
  * [calendar](http://kthornbloom.com/monthly/)
* AJAX

Final result can be seen here: https://hawthorn-redesign.now.sh/
