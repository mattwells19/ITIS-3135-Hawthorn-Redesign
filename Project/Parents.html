                <p>
                  As an engineer, one of the most important things for being
                  successful is having a friend in the same classes as you. At
                  the Freshman Learning Community, your student will be in the
                  same building as a majority of their classmates. The freshman
                  engineer schedule is very similar for all engineering majors,
                  so finding another student to help your student with the
                  material in class is easier than ever!
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Engineering FLC has many benefits to the students who join
                  and actively participate. It does not guarantee success. Our
                  goal is to surround the students with resources, help them
                  build a sense of community in the college, and provide
                  opportunities to learn about engineering to confirm their
                  career path. Our research shows supporting these areas helps
                  them succeed. However, the effort, hard work, and involvement
                  have to come from them.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Engineering students are brought together for many events
                  and classes, but also meet other students on campus. Several
                  of their classes during the freshman year are taken with the
                  general population, giving them an opportunity to make
                  connections with students and faculty outside of engineering.
                </p>

              <div class="content bottom">
                <p>
                  We know you want success for your young student and that this
                  is a transition period for both the student and the family.
                  Get involved! Attend Parents Weekend and other events to help
                  you become a
                  <a href="https://nsfs.uncc.edu/">Niner Nation family</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Please encourage your student to stay on campus the first few
                  weekends to help develop a sense of belonging here. It is
                  tempting to come home those first few weekends when the
                  homework load is light, but we want them to develop
                  friendships and habits to make their home here. Students who
                  have a strong sense of belonging are a move likely to stay in
                  school and graduate on time with their peers.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Encourage them to use the resources that are available in the
                  Lee College of Engineering and in the University. There are
                  loads of resources covering just about every potential
                  concern. If they aren't sure what resource to use, there is a
                  resource for that -they should ask their academic advisor or
                  their residential assistant for guidance.
