    <p>
        <b>Matt Wells</b> is a Computer Science student who focuses in robotics. Matt is
        also the Vice President and Webmaster for the Student Organization Charlotte Area
        robotics. Here is the website that he is working on:
        <a target="_blank" href="https://car-robotics.uncc.edu">https://car-robotics.uncc.edu</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Matt</b>, last summer, got an internship at SentryOne, a CCI Business Partner,
        and learned how to program in ReactJS. Matt decided he wanted to learn more so he
        decided to take Web-App design and development as a technical elective.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>He</b> hopes to learn more about back-end development as this is where
        he is most lost. Matt also hopes to learn more about accessibility and how to properly
        implement it into a website.
